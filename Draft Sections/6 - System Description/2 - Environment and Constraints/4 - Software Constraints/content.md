Users must have access to a Chromium or Firefox browser that supports browser extensions to interact with Comment Anywhere. It will function any operating system that supports those Browsers.

There are some additional software constraints relating to the Cloud. The business team requires flexibility in deployment so that they can pick any number of cloud hosting providers based on cost and speed needs. For maximum flexibility, the Back End will be designed to run inside a Docker Container, which is a virtualized, semi-independent operating system that packages all dependencies with the code. We will choose a low-cost cloud provider for the initial roll out. This cloud provider must support running of Docker Containers.

Examples of Providers that offer Cloud Hosting for Docker containers include:

- Amazon Elastic Container Service
- Microsoft Azure
- Kamatera
- A2 Hosting
- Jelastic
- StackPath
- Google Cloud Run
- Sloppy.io
- HostPresto
- Vultr
