Karl: I'm thinking today we start with Data flow diagrams. It seems as though we can build the specifications off of those.



The "Double Square" - a shadowed square, is a "source or destination of data".

That could comprise of our users: Guest, Member, Domain Moderator, Global Moderator, Admin.

The arrow indicates the flow of data.

The rounded rectangle is for a process; it "transforms a flow of data."

The open-ended rectangle (no shadow) indicates a store of data. E.g. the database.






**Question for Professor Chen**

Changing "Domain Moderator" in the requirements; either removing it all together, or having a flag with Global Moderators whereby they may or may not be able to create new Domain Moderators. In the initial roll out, we will likely only need Global Moderators.... but we don't want to give all our moderators the power to create new Moderators!
